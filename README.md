# Project : Basic ChatBot with ChatterBot with Django 
In this project, I have tried to initiate a chatbot using Chatterbot and Chatterbot-Corpus library. It is not an advanced chatbot. Because the library is not that enriched.

-Install the requirements.txt file. \
-The project is well commented to make it easily understandable. \
-**Chatterbot & Chatterbot-Corpus** is used to here to power the ChatBot
