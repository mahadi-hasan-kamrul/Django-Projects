The projects aim to keep track all kinds of personal expense. User can input all of his/her expenses in the app. The app will show the list of expenses, categories of expenses and will also visualize the expenses with colorful charts.

-Install the requirements.txt file. \
-Install node.js in computer. \
-Basic TailwindCSS has been used here to desing the interface. \
-Chart.js has been utilized to display charts. \
-The whole project is well commented which makes the project easy to understand. \
